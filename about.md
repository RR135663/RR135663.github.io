# About Me
Hello! I am RR135663.
My goals are to be an echocardiologist and work with some doctors and I want to go to college and have a successful future. I will have to go through many challenges and go to school a lot. This will be difficult but; thats okay. No path in life is a straight line.
Some of my interests are: Gaming, birds, soccer, Legos.
Some things that I like to do in my spare time are build legos when im stressed or play video games. Other times I like to to hike and work out whenever I am stressed or when I feel like I have nothing to do.
